Durantion: 30 minutes Good luck!!

To solve this test please use test1_tracking.csv in the following link https://github.com/nabihandres/coop2022_ROS_TEST.git

The test1_tracking.csv has information from the RADAR sensor while two people were walking. We need to create two plots about their motion in position on the x and y-axis. The "object 1" and "object 28" belong to student A, and "object 14" and "object 29".


Note: Write your answer in Colab Test
